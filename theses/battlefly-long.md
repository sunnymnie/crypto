# Battlefly thesis

Long Battlefly NFTs
## About Battlefly
- [Battlefly](https://docs.battlefly.game/overview/welcome-to-battlefly) is a game (in progress) that uses MAGIC and is integrated in the Treasure ecosystem. Requires buying a Battlefly NFT in advance to play the game

## Time horizens and expectations
- Selling during or just after Arbitrum Odyssey focusing on Treasure and Battlefly

## Bull theses
- The [Arbitrum Odyssey will be featuring Treasure and Battlefly](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/arbitrum-odyssey-begins-), and a lot of that attention will manifest in increased prices for MAGIC and for Battlefly NFTs
    - Arbitrum Odyssey [does not require buying Battlefly NFTs](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/953728887681081455/1004777499697365115). However, "Meanwhile having something thats more inclusive. Lets a lot more people see the project. More people could genuinely get into the project." - Kuma.   
    - Assumption: Arbitrum Odyssey will still 'have steam' when this promotion goes live. Want to keep track on dune (?)

## Bear theses
Given some of the bear theses can't be proven till later or until it's too late, I will hedge by taking profits early when they arise, and be open to start DCAing out as soon as I feel the probabilities have turned against me. 
- Battlefly game is not finished, but devs claim to be making big progress. Also ideologically opposed to pay-to-play via NFTs. 
- Lots of time between now and Arbitrum Odyssey resumption and event, and price can swing widly until then
- Arbitrum Odyssey possibly will not include requirement to buy Battlefly NFTs (tentatively verified). If other methods they pick are weak for price appreciation, prices may plummet if everyone with the same idea of selling into Odyssey starts listing at below floor price
- Battlefly game may not be finished before Odyssey. However, confirmed with Nick that they plan on releasing a playable version with 'most probable' probability before then

## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:
- playing the Racer game requires NFT
- speculators waiting for the main game to release
- people like me waiting for Arbitrum Odyssey pump

Sellers:
- People who are exiting the ecosystem 

### Expected change in supply and demand
Buyers (Increase):
- [Potentially](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1541828832868564992) huge increase in demand for Battleflys from Arbitrum Odyssey participants. Would only last for a day or so, but potentially huge liquidity
- Sustained demand if funneling huge volume of players leads to some sticking around after the initial promotion

Sellers (Decrease):
- none

Sellers (Increase):
- Huge liquidity will lead to many selling their Battleflys, which may be enough to quell the demand
- People who are buying with the intention of selling into the pump.

## Plan and risk tolerance
DCA Battlefly NFTs with a preference for 'uncommon' if possible. Want to maintain a balance between MAGIC:Battlefly NFTs, probably 1:3. Will plan to sell most during the lead-up to Arbitrum Odyssey and during the Odyssey week. May want to hold back on a few for my personal enjoyment, but keep no more than 3 by the end of Treasure+BattleFly week. 

## Possible outcomes and my reactions
### Pre-Aribtrum Odyssey resuming (before Aug 30)
If floor price stays or goes down, I will buy whenever I have enough MAGIC. IF floor price goes up, I will buy when I have excess MAGIC. Perform balancing act between NFTs and MAGIC

### Post Arbitrum resuming but pre Treasure+Battlefly event
- If Battlefly NFTs floor prices keep rising, chances are it's people pricing in Arbitrum Odyssey's impact. Keep buying if I have excess MAGIC or low-steals and try doing some arbitrage by selling high the NFTs already collected
    - May want to start selling some NFTs early to hedge the risk that Arbitrum Odyssey isn't bullish
- If Battlefly NFTs floor prices is falling or stays the same, keep DCAing normal or slightly reserved levels

### During Arbitrum Treasure + Battlefly event ETA Sept 3-9
- Want to liquidate most of my position in the first few days to make sure no second-hand NFTs are competing with my sell pressure
- Want to be out most of my position by the end of the event
