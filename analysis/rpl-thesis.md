# Rocketpool thesis

Long RPL. [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/nmorlock42/status/1551236059580735489). 'high beta ETH with downside protection and asymmetric upside'

## About RPL
- it has much more intrinsic value than just governance (collateral)
- To stake [17.6](https://rocketpool.net/node-operators) ETH, user has to provide collateral between 10% and 150% of ETH in RPL


## Time horizens and expectations
- medium to long-term (1-3 years?)

## Bull theses
- it is tied by design to the value of ETH (?). If ETH goes up (1) new stakers need to buy more RPL to meet 10% min, and (2) existing stakers need to buy more RPL to collect RPL rewards (?). RPL is tied to the value of ETH
- Downside protection: RPL has real utility. As long as new node operators want to stake with Rocketpool, they need to buy RPL. 
- 

## Bear theses
- Rocketpool starts to become a less popular staking solution (then what?)

## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:
- Node operators who want to stake with Rocketpool
Sellers:
- 5% (?) inflation rewards

### Expected change in supply and demand
Buyers (Increase):
- Increase in ETH staking rewards following merge (?) will lead to more people who want to stake but don't meet 32 ETH requirement

## Plan and risk tolerance
- Slowly DCA and continually learn about RPL. 

## Possible outcomes and my reactions
