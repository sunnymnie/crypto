- Reality maximalism. Do not let personal preferences shine through to investment theses building. See what is working well and why, look at 'facts on the ground'. 
    - ie, saw Ethereum was very centralized and was for shady ICOs, but was the right play. 
    - Analogy: be a leaf in the sky and just ride the wind of crypto movements
- Note most crypto projects start off centralized. SOL now is similar to what ETH was like ago
    - First it was BTC thinking ETH is centralized scam chain. Now it's ETH thinking other L1s as centralized scam chains. 
    - Spectrum of decentralization: where do you draw the line: BTC, ETH, ATOM, SOL, LUNA, ONE, NEAR, BSC?
- Chain maximalism is a trap: both investment and mind trap. Bankless is decentralization maximalism: realized not best performance in the short term.
- Decentralization as a guiding principle, not a required checkbox? Current non-decentralized projects (AVAX, SOL, etc) compared to silk-road as onboarding ramps. 
- Regulations clamps down on fair-launch projects, so more regulation safe to do private sale. So many fail-launch projects are scams. 
- New L1s are fast because they are centralized. ETH becoming decentralized over time was due to culture of decentralization, not sure if shared with new L1s when they depend on centralization for their only way of competing against ETH: fast throughput.
- New chains uding PoS and DPoS and inflation rewards--wealth stays at the hands of the vcs--not seemingly becoming more decentralized. + regulation. 
- Denominate in ETH
