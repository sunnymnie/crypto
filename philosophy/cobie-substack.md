## Trading the metagame
https://cobie.substack.com/p/trading-the-metagame
- Crypto bull-run stages more similar to video games than investing

### Ethereum killers
- Obvious and enduring metagame of 2021
- "Which L1s have not pumped yet relative to market average?"
- durable metagame because Eth fees broken. Until this changes, this metagame expected to remain strong

### Crazy Caterpillars and Dizzy Ducks
- Some metagames fleeting and unsustainable
- NFT mints popular metagame in a short period in 2021. New projects like Hashmasks and BAYC oversubscribed causing hyped secondary markets
- 99% of cases buying in secondary market lost out. 
- trend cannibalized itself with unsustainable incentive structure
- Biggest winner: those aware of metagame and incentive structure

### Evolution of the metagame
- Summer 2020: 
    - DeFi summer
    - Yield farming
    - Food coins
- Fall 2020:
    - BTC dominance run: revival of 'blue chip' DeFi led by Aave
    - NFT boom--NiftyGateway sales
- 2021
    - Shitcoin season
    - alt L1 season
    - GameFi inspired by AXS
    - NFT season dominated by OpenSea
    - Art Blocks season
    - 'old NFTs are good' trend
    - alt L1 ecosystem season with BSC, Avax, Luna

Biggest losers: Misidentifying current metagame as something else

Usually metagames start with long-term investment thesis transitioning to popularity and ending with mimetic exuberance. 

### Is knowing the metagame enough?
- Generally yes
- Be disciplined: control during euphoric periods and lower leverage and cash out
- Very important to understand incentive dynamics behind a metagame
    - Can easier find when a metagame is dead and what new metagames are
    - SOL vs AVAX Defi. Avax defi did well, but SOL defi, while having near identical investment theses was plagued by a sub-metagame of high FDV. Avax coins were much more community orientated. 

### Watching winners and solving problems
Crypto meta rooted in successes and failures
- Alt L1 metagame rooted in Eth successes but enabled in Eth's failures. 

Crypto metagame starts due to 'winner' being catalyst
- AXS sparked gamefi

### Community > problems
Metagame due to community's desire to be early
- DOGE, SHIB, BSC, BAYC, AVAX, GME
- 'we aren't playing their game, it's our turn to be rich'

### Non-narrative metas (past metas)
- FTX listings were always bullish/front-running Binance/Coinbase coin listings
- Copying trading some VCs
- On-chain analysis and whale watching
- Shady private sale deals

### Using the meta
- identify possible dog-coin meta after Doge pumps
- defi-summer dynamics on Avax: massive gains
- identify dynamics and incentives-->figure out if meta has positive feedback loop/sustained growth ability or would rapidly burn out. 
- It is the meta to long the meta during good-looking markets
- Don't use a dead metagame: BTC dominance based in 2017 meta, S2F model, etc
- Don't run head-first into a metagame reaching exuberance: if already thought 5/6 times about a trade and weeks/months have passed: that is maximally risky. If meta is common knowledge, meta is dead.
