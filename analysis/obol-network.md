# Obol network

## Summary
Eth staking, Distributed validator technology, allows for combining multiple computers into single staking network. 
## Vision
- DAO trusts _groups of members_ to run validators together for treasury ETH
- Friends pool together 32 ether to spin up a shared node

## Bull thesis
1. Obol integrated inside every staking protocol and consumer staking software
2. Staking-as-a-service companies and protocols (Coinbase Cloud, Lido, RocketPool) distributes their validation risk with Obol and DVT
3. Quality + quantity of Liquid Staking Derivatives (stETH, rETH) grows and becomes highly competitive
4. ETH retail stakers can compete with professionalized and competitive services
