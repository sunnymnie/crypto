# Ethereum Classic short
Over the past few days, ETC has jumped from $15 to $40. Is this a safe opportunity to go short?

## Time horizens and expectations
- Can be as short as a week, to weeks after the Merge in September. 
- Looking at a potential 50% fall if prices fall back to $20 pre-pump

## ETC status-quo
- Small TVL ~6000 ETC or $200,000 compared to ETH $57b. 
- Relatively dead chain with a big spike in users and volume due to attention

## Bull theses
- The Merge is the catalyst needed to start off a reneaissance in ETC ecosystem development
    - AntPool mining pool giving $10m to support ETC ecosystem [coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/26/antpool-supports-ethereum-classic-ecosystem-with-10m-investment/)
- Increase in ETC hashrate -- becoming more secure
- There will be a migration of capital and users from ETH to ETC ecosystem, fueled by increased security, cheap fees, doubt in PoS. However, no migration is currently taking place, and even if there is, it would be small and temporary and irrelevant in the grand scheme of things 
- Miners are incentivized to help ETC ecosystem grow. However, this is too long to have an impact on my trade, and requires a lot of things to go wrong with PoS ETH. 
- Hedge for if the merge goes wrong. However, there will likely be an ETH fork closer to the merge. 

## Bear theses
- Speculation and attention will die off and status-quo would be resumed
- Miners playing a game of chicken -- who will exit ETC first. 

## Supply Demand changes
### Current Supply/Demand in the pump
- Buyers
    - ETH Merge FUD / PoS doubters selling ETH for ETC as a hedge (probably very small share)
    - Speculators and retail piling on because price is going up
    - short-sellers being liquidated
- Sellers
    - Miners

### Changes in supply/demand I am forecasting:
- Reduction in buyers:
    - Speculators and retail would run out and then trend will start reversing
    - Shorts will finish liquidating
- Increase in sellers:
    - (?) after the Merge, potentially lots of miners move to ETC for quick profit by selling 

## Plan and risk tolerance
- Trade will involve long ETH short ETC
- Limit sell orders placed between $41 and $45 and small market sell. 
- Planned take profits at ~0.014 ETC/ETH, or around $23 currently. May exit at ~$20 if it comes first. 

### Possible outcomes and how I plan to react
- [50%] ETC either falls or hovers at current ~$40 range for a while before falling. It then hits my take profits at 0.014 ETC/ETH or $20
- [40%] ETC goes another leg up, this time somewhere in the range of $60-80, before levelling out and coming down. As long as I read the supply/demand dynamics correctly and the bull theses are encompassing and are not playing out, I will add on more shorts at that range, probably in equal proportions to previous leg
    - [50%] ETC goes up as a short-squeeze or makes another leg up over $80, this time say $150 or $400. By this time I will continue adding to my shorts but very little. The only logical way this can be sustainable is if the bull theses are playing out or there is another case I did not account for. I would be adding more capital and shorting in decreasing amounts, and will be trying to exit my position much earlier than 0.014 ETC/ETH. 
    - [25%] ETC balances out at this price till end of September. I may take the `L` and quit if I have other trades I am interested in taking part in. Else I will continue holding. 
    - [25] ETC goes down. 
- [10%] ETC may go up or down slightly but unmeaningful. If ETC is at $30-$50 range after September, I may sell if I find better trading opportunities, or if the bull theses are being played out
