# Treasure.lol + Battlefly thesis

Long MAGIC and Battlefly NFTs
## About Treasure and Battlefly
- [Treasure](https://www.treasure.lol/) is a decentralized game console connecting games with a common currency MAGIC
- [Battlefly](https://docs.battlefly.game/overview/welcome-to-battlefly) is a game (in progress) that uses MAGIC and is integrated in the Treasure ecosystem. Requires buying a Battlefly NFT in advance to play the game

## Time horizens and expectations
- Selling during or just after Arbitrum Odyssey focusing on Treasure and Battlefly

## Bull theses
- The [Arbitrum Odyssey will be featuring Treasure and Battlefly](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/arbitrum-odyssey-begins-), and a lot of that attention will manifest in increased prices for MAGIC and for Battlefly NFTs
    - Arbitrum Odyssey [does not require buying Battlefly NFTs](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/953728887681081455/1004777499697365115). However, "Meanwhile having something thats more inclusive. Lets a lot more people see the project. More people could genuinely get into the project." - Kuma.   
    - Assumption: Arbitrum Odyssey will still 'have steam' when this promotion goes live. Want to keep track on dune (?)

## Bear theses
Given some of the bear theses can't be proven till later or until it's too late, I will hedge by taking profits early when they arise, and be open to start DCAing out as soon as I feel the probabilities have turned against me. 
- Game not built yet, to play you need an NFT which is incredibly bearish (may change?). All in all just a dumb ecosystem that I don't think has any value. Can't play any game cause they require a few hundred of something upfront via NFT. 
- Lots of time between now and Arbitrum Odyssey resumption and event, and price can swing widly until then
- Arbitrum Odyssey can drop Treasure / Battlefly or the criteria may not require buying MAGIC or Battlefly NFTs (verified)
- Battlefly game may not be finished before Odyssey. However, confirmed with Nick that they plan on releasing a playable version with 'most probable' probability before then

## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:
- MAGIC for playing the games
- Battlefly NFTs for playing the game
- Current ETH-centric pump being on the periphery of the Merge

Sellers:
- People who are exiting the ecosystem 

### Expected change in supply and demand
Buyers (Increase):
- [Potentially](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1541828832868564992) huge increase in demand for MAGIC and Battleflys from Arbitrum Odyssey participants. Would only last for a day or so, but potentially huge liquidity

Sellers (Decrease):
- none

Sellers (Increase):
- Huge liquidity will lead to many selling their Battleflys, which may be enough to quell the demand

## Plan and risk tolerance
- Small MAGIC buys + small NFT buying until Arbitrum resumes Aug 30th. 
- If the first few weeks resulted in increased usage (check dune) of promoted protocols, step up MAGIC buys and Battlefly NFTs if warranted
- I'll start by buying the cheapest Battlefly NFTs and setting limit orders. May want to do some research to see if rarity plays a big role for price, but only [15%](https://docs.battlefly.game/battleflys/rarity) advantage to rarity
- Want to keep MAGIC + Battlefly NFT position < 20% of entire portfolio, 5%-10% is a good range pre-pump
- (FALSE) Want position to be around 75%-90% Battlefly NFTs, 10%-25% MAGIC. Reason is that I think if MAGIC does well, Battleflys would be doing just as well, bt clearly possible Battleflys do well and MAGIC stays flat. 
- Sell at around September 3rd (?) when the Treasure + Battlefly promotion starts. Exit around 90% to 100% of my position, unless in that time I find that MAGIC and Battlefly NFTs possibly can keep growing. 

## Possible outcomes and my reactions
### Pre-Aribtrum Odyssey resuming (before Aug 30)
- MAGIC price between $0.6-$0, I will continue small levels of weekly DCAs
- MAGIC price goes between $0.6-$2, I will DCA a bit less
- MAGIC price goes >$2, I will be DCAing out
- Set limit offers below floor price, sometimes buying the cheapest

### Post Arbitrum resuming but pre Treasure+Battlefly event
- If MAGIC is trending up just ride, don't bother DCAing
- If MAGIC is trending down, keep on normal levels of DCA
- If Battlefly NFTs floor prices keep rising, chances are it's people pricing in Arbitrum Odyssey's impact. Keep buying but in longer intervals and try doing some arbitrage by selling high the NFTs already collected
- If Battlefly NFTs floor prices is falling or stays the same, keep DCAing normal levels
- May want to start selling some NFTs early to hedge the risk that Arbitrum Odyssey isn't bullish

### During Arbitrum Treasure + Battlefly event ETA Sept 3-9
- Want to liquidate most of my position in the first few days to make sure no second-hand NFTs are competing with my sell pressure
- Want to be out most of my position by the end of the event
