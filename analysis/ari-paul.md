- defi, don't know, defi 2.0 don't touch
- small bets on Uniswap and Aave -- fundamentally sound for 2-3 year
- maker, truefi, maple, centrifuge wanting a 10x exiting on a bubble

- Long eth and solana, small solana though. No idea about SOL phone. 
- no opinion on the merge. If merge goes on time and smoothly then won't be surprised by some consolidation around eth for 6-12 months. Not in the loop but so far there's no eth scaling solution -- OP and Arbitrum are $2 transaction fees. 
- Is not expecting eth pumping and nothing else pumping, there is cool tech made by alt-L1 ecosystems

- Worried about BTC in 5 years as it can be economically rational to short BTC and attack it given falling prices in ASICs. Share worry with POW generally. Consensus is BTC will fork, but (1) social layer of BTC would prevent that and (2) new POW chain would be easier to attack. Status quo with BTC constantly forking? POS more sound, even if attacker doesn't aquire ETH but 'social engineer', but that happens with BTC miners as well. 

- Outlook for next few months: Can bounce up to 33k BTC, 3-6mo rally or 2-8week rally and still fit in bear. Low conviction.
