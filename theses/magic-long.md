Long MAGIC 
## About Treasure 
- [Treasure](https://www.treasure.lol/) is a decentralized game console connecting games with a common currency MAGIC

## Time horizens and expectations
- Selling during or just after Arbitrum Odyssey focusing on Treasure and Battlefly

## Bull theses
- The [Arbitrum Odyssey will be featuring Treasure](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/arbitrum-odyssey-begins-), and a lot of that attention will manifest in increased prices for MAGIC. [The narrative will be deafening](https://twitter.com/NorthRockLP/status/1561913502951870466)
- Most of the owners of MAGIC are builders who need it for their games, so will unlikely sell. [11:00](https://twitter.com/Reformed_Normie/status/1552620858765721601?t=zJKEUDauM8gWtmzJx7L30A&s=19)

- Halvening: September 1st, MAGIC emissions will be halved
- AMM
- recruit revamp

## Bear theses
Given some of the bear theses can't be proven till later or until it's too late, I will hedge by taking profits early when they arise, and be open to start DCAing out as soon as I feel the probabilities have turned against me. 
- Lots of time between now and Arbitrum Odyssey resumption and event, and price can swing widly until then
- Arbitrum Odyssey may not directly or indirectly pursuade people to buy MAGIC

## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:
- MAGIC for playing the games
- Current ETH-centric pump being on the periphery of the Merge

Sellers:
- People who are exiting the ecosystem 

### Expected change in supply and demand
Buyers (Increase):
- [Potentially](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1541828832868564992) huge increase in demand for MAGIC from Arbitrum Odyssey participants. Would only last for a day or so, but potentially huge liquidity

Sellers (Decrease):
- none

Sellers (Increase):
- Many may want to sell MAGIC given the pump

## Plan and risk tolerance
Conditional DCA
- Want to liquidate most of my position in the first few days of the Odyssey event
