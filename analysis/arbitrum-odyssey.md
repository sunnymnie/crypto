## Hop
Bridge
- [Token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/hop-protocol): [Tokenmonics](https://hop.mirror.xyz/AI5fOUR0X_l0mktShDOx3mwr-hsB24gp8GvTWtS-MBc)

## Lending/borrowing
### Yield Protocol
Fixed-rate borrowing and lending
- Token: no
- Opinion: Seems redundant given Aave? Current MVP does not seem to work yet

## Decentralized perpetual exchange
### GMX
- [GMX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gmx): GMX is the utility and governance token. Accrues 30% of the platform's generated fees.
    - [dune](https://dune.com/shogun/gmx-analytics-arbitrum)
- GLP: liquidity provider token. Accrues 70% of the platform's generated fees.
- Opinion: seems very promising, high fees though (0.1% vs Binance's 0.02%). Price has also went up a lot already. Want to do more research

### Aboard Exchange
- Token: probably not
- Opinion: spelling mistakes and buggy. Much cheaper fees if I understand what is going on. 

### Apex
- [APEX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apex-token): [tokenomics](https://docs.apex.exchange/apex/fees-and-associated-costs)
- Opinion: 0.1% trading fees are high, seems to work good


## NFT
### TofuNFT
- Token: probably not
- Opinion: seems like a decent NFT marketplace, tad empty. I don't know how to invest in it even if I wanted to

## Liquidity as a service
### Izumi/Yin Finance
- [IZI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/izumi-finance): [tokenomics](https://docs.izumi.finance/tokens/tokenomics)
- Opinion: seems confusing, not sure what or how to interact with it

## Trading protocol
### Dodo
- [DODO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dodo)
- Opinion: seems pretty cool, prices are bit higher than Uniswap, but haven't actually swapped

### Swapr
- [SWPR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/swapr)
- Opinion: seems like DODO, but doesn't have their own 'liquidty pool'

## Crypto games
### TreasureDAO
- [MAGIC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/magic)
- decentralized video game console connecting games and communities together
- Opinion: seems interesting

### Battlefly
- Uses MAGIC currency
- a game. Will give it a try. 

## Miscellaneous
### Ideamarket
- [IMO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ideamarket)
- vote on posts, which are actually NFTs
- Opinion: Not sure it has any value or purpose

## Bluechips
### Uniswap

### Sushiswap

### 1inch
