Long Battlefly NFTs
## About Battlefly
- [Battlefly](https://docs.battlefly.game/overview/welcome-to-battlefly) is a game (in progress) that uses MAGIC and is integrated in the Treasure ecosystem. Requires buying a Battlefly NFT in advance to play the game

### About the game
- First phase: stake 1 MAGIC per battle. When a battle is called: auto-fight, cannot decline, cannot change load-out, view 3D battle but no player-control. Main goal is to have a loadout that will win more than it loses. Winner gets loser's MAGIC. High-performing winners also get emissions from (?) team's staked MAGIC --> 7-10% ROI daily is the goal. 
    - Current Battlefly treasury: 3.5 million MAGIC, and is using that to generate MAGIC emissions for game. 
- Increase in Tournaments can hopefully raise to over 1000 DAU. Team is very iterative, wanting to test hypotheses. Currently Racer has two plans: (1) from elite NFT racing game that people like to watch and stream + tournaments, or (2) relaxing Metamask mobile enabled farming game for Nectar.
- Battlefly has a shield and hull. Once shield is worn down, then hull can be destroyed. Shield is always regenerating.
- Balance with Nectar and wins: More loses --> more Nectar --> better loadout --> more wins. Collecting nectar early with Racer helps with getting a head start with loadouts

Questions:
- Would the Racer game continue to be around for Phase 2 and 3? Would it be around for Seasons 2 and allow users to farm Nectar? 
- I heard that the plan for the Odyssey is to allow new people to rent Battleflies so they can play the Racer game and start to accumulate nectar? Is this true? If it is, would there be a market for battlefly owners to 'rent out' their battleflies, or would the UX simply be to charge a small fee to play Racer without having an actual Battlefly? Is the team trying to get Phase 2's Gardens and Hyperdome gameplay out before the Treasure+Battlefly Odyssey week, or would that be after? (I'm expecting Treasure + Battlefly week to be ~October/November)
- Is there any documentation regarding the 'mods', such as weapons or systems? So far the most detail I can get is through (https://play.battlefly.game/mission-control/staking/), but I could only get information from the battleflies I have. So for example, is there some resource that can tell me how much hull/HP a battlefly will have by default? Or the default shield HP & its regeneration per second? Or does that resouce not exist yet because those numbers/mods are currently just for example and can change a lot until Phase 2 is released?
- For the Garden and Hyperdome in Phase 2, could I put my Battlefly in the Garden/Hyperdome and essentially just shut my computer off and let the collecting/battling happen automatically? Or do I have to be present and engaging with the game? (From my knowledge, Hyperdome battles will be auto-fight and the user would just watch)
- Is there an ETA on when Racer will be available on Mobile? 

## Time horizens and expectations
- Selling during or just after Arbitrum Odyssey focusing on Treasure and Battlefly
- Upon further research, game seems to have potential and may be fun. Will make sure to keep a few battleflies left to continue playing the game

## Bull theses
- The [Arbitrum Odyssey will be featuring Battlefly](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/arbitrum-odyssey-begins-), and a lot of that attention will manifest in increased prices for MAGIC and for Battlefly NFTs
    - Arbitrum Odyssey [does not require buying Battlefly NFTs](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/953728887681081455/1004777499697365115). However [will allow players to rent a Battlefly to play Racer](https://twitter.com/Reformed_Normie/status/1552620858765721601?t=zJKEUDauM8gWtmzJx7L30A&s=19) and there will be cool leaderboard prizes as well (30:00). From Kuma: "Meanwhile having something thats more inclusive. Lets a lot more people see the project. More people could genuinely get into the project." From BigDawgWoof [(39:00)](https://twitter.com/Reformed_Normie/status/1552620858765721601?t=zJKEUDauM8gWtmzJx7L30A&s=19): Not trying anything too crazy for odyssey, just to get people to play (racer?) to see how fun the game is. 
    - Our plan is to run a huge Arbitrum Odyssey event, let players collect a metric shit-tonne of Nectar, and then open up the game so that the 100k+ people who have played want to get into the game.

    - Assumption: Arbitrum Odyssey will still 'have steam' when this promotion goes live. Want to keep track on dune (?)

## Bear theses
Given some of the bear theses can't be proven till later or until it's too late, I will hedge by taking profits early when they arise, and be open to start DCAing out as soon as I feel the probabilities have turned against me. 
- Battlefly game is not finished, but devs claim to be making big progress. Also ideologically opposed to pay-to-play via NFTs. Counter: they are potentially adding cheap on-ramps to playing via renting NFTs? 
- Lots of time between now and Arbitrum Odyssey resumption and event, and price can swing widly until then. However, team is working hard on promotions via tournaments.
- Arbitrum Odyssey possibly will not include requirement to buy Battlefly NFTs (tentatively verified). If other methods they pick are weak for price appreciation, prices may plummet if everyone with the same idea of selling into Odyssey starts listing at below floor price
- Battlefly game may not be finished before Odyssey. However, confirmed with Nick that they plan on releasing a playable version with 'most probable' probability before then

## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:
- playing the Racer game requires NFT
- speculators waiting for the main game to release
- people like me waiting for Arbitrum Odyssey pump

Sellers:
- People who are exiting the ecosystem 

### Expected change in supply and demand
Buyers (Increase):
- [Potentially](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1541828832868564992) huge increase in demand for Battleflys from Arbitrum Odyssey participants. Would only last for a day or so, but potentially huge liquidity
- Sustained demand if funneling huge volume of players leads to some sticking around after the initial promotion

Sellers (Decrease):
- Potentially (depending on implementation) users may want to rent out their battleflies if that is possible

Sellers (Increase):
- Huge liquidity will lead to many selling their Battleflys, which may be enough to quell the demand
- People who are buying with the intention of selling into the pump.

## Plan and risk tolerance
DCA Battlefly NFTs with a preference for 'uncommon' if possible. Want to maintain a balance between MAGIC:Battlefly NFTs, probably 1:3. Will plan to sell most during the lead-up to Arbitrum Odyssey and during the Odyssey week. May want to hold back on a few for my personal enjoyment, but keep no more than 3 by the end of Treasure+BattleFly week. 

## Possible outcomes and my reactions
### Pre-Aribtrum Odyssey resuming (before Aug 30)
If floor price stays or goes down, I will buy whenever I have enough MAGIC. IF floor price goes up, I will buy when I have excess MAGIC. Perform balancing act between NFTs and MAGIC

### Post Arbitrum resuming but pre Treasure+Battlefly event
- If Battlefly NFTs floor prices keep rising, chances are it's people pricing in Arbitrum Odyssey's impact. Keep buying if I have excess MAGIC or low-steals and try doing some arbitrage by selling high the NFTs already collected
    - May want to start selling some NFTs early to hedge the risk that Arbitrum Odyssey isn't bullish
- If Battlefly NFTs floor prices is falling or stays the same, keep DCAing normal or slightly reserved levels

### During Arbitrum Treasure + Battlefly event ETA Sept 3-9
- Want to liquidate most of my position in the first few days to make sure no second-hand NFTs are competing with my sell pressure
- Want to be out most of my position by the end of the event
- Consider buying back a few weeks/months after Odyssey if I am still regularly playing the game and I am in-line with the mission and team is making progress
