# Battlefly thesis

Long Battlefly NFTs. Probabilistic thinking: high chance Odyssey happens & high chance Odyssey is bullish & good chance capable team will use that to create short-term and long-term demand & high chance there will be no price suppression

## About Battlefly
- [Battlefly](https://docs.battlefly.game/overview/welcome-to-battlefly) is a game (in progress) that uses MAGIC and is integrated in the Treasure ecosystem. Requires buying a Battlefly NFT in advance to play the game

### About the game
- First phase: stake 1 MAGIC per battle. When a battle is called: auto-fight, cannot decline, cannot change load-out, view 3D battle but no player-control. Main goal is to have a loadout that will win more than it loses. Winner gets loser's MAGIC. High-performing winners also get emissions from (?) team's staked MAGIC --> 7-10% ROI daily is the goal. 
    - Current Battlefly treasury: 3.5 million MAGIC, and is using that to generate MAGIC emissions for game. 
- Increase in Tournaments can hopefully raise to over 1000 DAU. Team is very iterative, wanting to test hypotheses. Currently Racer has two plans: (1) from elite NFT racing game that people like to watch and stream + tournaments, or (2) relaxing Metamask mobile enabled farming game for Nectar.
- Ethics alignment: First time lead dev for Racer met a crypto games company who hired him for his game developing and community building skills and not to make a quick buck flipping NFTs. [fly ones](https://youtu.be/P4olCXV7fhA?t=1138). Main goals: game is (1) accessible (2) sustainable (3) inclusive. Accessible is a key challenge with a crypto game which will need addressing

#### Game mechanics
- Battlefly has a shield and hull. Once shield is worn down, then hull can be destroyed. Shield is always regenerating.
- Balance with Nectar and wins: More loses --> more Nectar --> better loadout --> more wins. Collecting nectar early with Racer helps with getting a head start with loadouts

#### Battlefly Racer
- Originally planned to be a mini-game just to indicate that the devs are working on the main game and in the meantime people can play 
- Now figuring out how Racer fits in the main game with the help of the community

#### Factions
- Potentially some alpha for investing in this game by picking factions interested in, collecting nectar which will have lots of uses with mods, and mods will be very fun and gamey [fly ones](https://youtu.be/P4olCXV7fhA?t=1037)

#### Odyssey plan / Inflation plan
- üî¥: keep an eye out to information on how the team plans to approach the Odyssey. So far seems to be '[renting](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/947301847037771816/1013574453508186224)'/[battlepass](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/947301847037771816/1013626452505264159) for the near future (Odyssey), which assuming they [agree](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/947301847037771816/1013626452505264159) to [my synopsis](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/947301847037771816/1013624508365684760) means that they "are fine with the price rising, as in the short term there will be alternate ways to play with low capital (renting), and in the long term breeding and faction 'spawning' will maintain a sustainable supply of '2nd class/low quality' Battleflies to enter the market for cheap ways to get into the game"


## Time horizens and expectations
- Selling during or just after Arbitrum Odyssey focusing on Treasure and Battlefly
- Upon further research, game seems to have potential and may be fun. Will make sure to keep a few battleflies left to continue playing the game

## Bull theses
### üêÇ The Odyssey will create massive interest in Battlefly
- The [Arbitrum Odyssey will be featuring Battlefly](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/arbitrum-odyssey-begins-), and a lot of that attention will manifest in increased prices for MAGIC and for Battlefly NFTs
    - Arbitrum Odyssey [will allow players to rent a Battlefly to play Racer](https://twitter.com/Reformed_Normie/status/1552620858765721601?t=zJKEUDauM8gWtmzJx7L30A&s=19) and there will be cool leaderboard prizes as well (30:00). From Kuma: "Meanwhile having something thats more inclusive. Lets a lot more people see the project. More people could genuinely get into the project." From BigDawgWoof [(39:00)](https://twitter.com/Reformed_Normie/status/1552620858765721601?t=zJKEUDauM8gWtmzJx7L30A&s=19): Not trying anything too crazy for odyssey, just to get people to play (racer?) to see how fun the game is. 
    - Our plan is to run a huge Arbitrum Odyssey event, let players collect a metric shit-tonne of Nectar, and then open up the game so that the 100k+ people who have played want to get into the game. [OfficialAbenger](https://discord.com/channels/882867268021800991/958963188903329792/1005970872785444935)
    - Assumption: Arbitrum Odyssey will still 'have steam' when this promotion goes live. Want to keep track on dune (?)

### üêÇ The game will be good
- Battlefly has been prioritizing the game over the 'crypto' aspect, which is essential for any 'crypto game' to take off sustainably. Hiring Jyroblade, whom purports to have a decade experience building games professionally and only joined Battlefly out of any other crypto game is the ethos alignment (see Fly Ones)
- Have already made a decent game, therefore I can trust their word when they say they're working on other exciting projects

## Bear theses
### üêª Odyssey not bullish enough [60% false]
- ‚ùóLots of time between now and Arbitrum Odyssey resumption and event, and price can swing widly until then. 
    - team is working hard on promotions via tournaments (so far failing though...)
- Arbitrum Odyssey possibly will not include requirement to buy Battlefly NFTs (tentatively verified [[1](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/953728887681081455/1004777499697365115)]). If other methods they pick are weak for price appreciation, prices may plummet if everyone with the same idea of selling into Odyssey starts listing at below floor price
    - Team's attitude towards Odyssey is to funnel everyone towards having a great experience with the game rather than short-term price pump [[1](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/953728887681081455/1004777499697365115)]

### üêª Game not good enough [95% false]
- Battlefly game may not be finished before Odyssey. 
    - However, confirmed with Nick that they plan on releasing a playable version with 'most probable' probability before then. 
    - Also Racer is already out and is a decent game.
- Battlefly game may not be well received
    - team adding cheap on-ramps to playing via renting & lead developers (Jyroblade) has accessibility in mind 

### üêª Price will be artificially suppressed for inclusivity [95% false]
- Battlefly team may not want BF NFTs to rise in price and may have other 'investable assets' for the purpose of investing in the game. 
    - Asked in Disord. The devs are planning on increasing the supply eventually, but no measures are being undertaken now (persumably due to working on Season 1). Devs aren't planning for a possible spike in price during the Odyssey week. [[1](https://discord.com/channels/940822048106745927/947301847037771816/1013294066194206790)]
    - See [inflation](#odyssey-plan--inflation-plan) plan. Team is not planning on suppressing price of Battlefly NFTs 

## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:
- playing the Racer game requires NFT
- speculators waiting for the main game to release
- people like me waiting for Arbitrum Odyssey pump

Sellers:
- People who are exiting the ecosystem 

### Expected change in supply and demand
üü© Buyers (Increase):
- [Potentially](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1541828832868564992) huge increase in demand for Battleflys from Arbitrum Odyssey participants. Would only last for a day or so, but potentially huge demand
- Sustained demand if funneling huge volume of players leads to some sticking around after the initial promotion, which is the main goal of the Battlefly team

üü© Sellers (Decrease):
- [likely false] Potentially (depending on implementation) users may want to rent out their battleflies if that is possible 
- Huge narrative will prevent people from wanting to sell their Battleflies

üü• Sellers (Increase):
- Huge liquidity will lead to many selling their Battleflys, which may be enough to quell the demand
- People who are buying with the intention of selling into the pump.

## Plan and risk tolerance
Accumulate Battlefly NFTs with a preference for 'uncommon' if possible. Want to maintain a balance between MAGIC:Battlefly NFTs, probably 1:1. Will plan to sell most during the lead-up to Arbitrum Odyssey and during the Odyssey week. May want to hold back on a few for my personal enjoyment, but keep no more than 1/3 by the end of Treasure+BattleFly week. 

## Possible outcomes and my reactions
### Pre-Arbitrum Odyssey resuming 
Accumulate 'commons' when they are way below floor price via sniping noob listings and setting low collection-wide bids. Accumulate 'uncommon' when they are very close to the floor price and the floor has not gone up a lot recently. Generally just take advantage of market inefficiencies and get both common and uncommon for cheap. Buy when MAGIC price is cheap (USD value), and when cheap ETH value. 

### Post Arbitrum resuming but pre Treasure+Battlefly event
- If Battlefly NFTs floor prices keep rising, chances are it's people pricing in Arbitrum Odyssey's impact. Keep buying if I have excess MAGIC or low-steals and try doing some arbitrage by selling high the NFTs already collected
    - May want to start selling some NFTs early to hedge the risk that Arbitrum Odyssey isn't actually bullish
- If Battlefly NFTs floor prices is falling or stays the same, keep accumulating as normal or slightly reserved levels
- Continue revising thesis as more information comes out regarding their approach to Odyssey and measures (not) taken to alleviate demand by increasing supply. If the stars align, can step up accumulation. Or can try and find other materials to accumulate that aren't potentially soft-capped. 

### During Arbitrum Treasure + Battlefly event ETA Oct 11-17 (assuming GMX week starts Sept 6)
- Want to liquidate most of my position in the first few days to make sure no second-hand NFTs are competing with my sell pressure
- Want to be out most of my position by the end of the event
- Consider buying back a few weeks/months after Odyssey if I am still regularly playing the game and I am resonate with the mission and team is making progress
