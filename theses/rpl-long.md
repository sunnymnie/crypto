## About RPL
- it has much more intrinsic value than just governance (collateral requirement to stake)
- To stake [16](https://rocketpool.net/node-operators) ETH, user has to provide collateral between 10% and 150% of ETH in RPL


## Time horizens and expectations
- medium to long-term (1-3 years?)
- probably a euphoric pump sometime after the merge, probably slowly growing for months to come as more stake

## Bull theses
- it is tied by design to the value of ETH. If ETH goes up new stakers need to [buy more RPL](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/create-validator.html#staking-rpl) to meet 10% min, and (2) existing stakers need to buy more RPL to collect RPL rewards [source](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/rewards.html#rewards-and-checkpoints)
- Downside protection: RPL has real utility. As long as new node operators want to stake with Rocketpool, they need to buy RPL. Reasons to stake with Rocketpool: (1) decentralized, (2) <32 ETH, (3) greater staking commission by between 5% and 20% depending on when minipool set up. 
- (short term) The Merge will create influx of stakers due to staking rate 4%->7% (need source) which will lead to new node operators
- stETH vs rETH
    - A reason to hold rETH over stETH is because less tax events: stETH value is equal ETH and you accrue rewards by recieving more stETH. So by holding stETH you're recieving stETH and will need to pay income tax. With rETH, the value grows with respect to ETH proportional to the staking rewards instead of recieving additional rETH. So your only tax event is when you sell your rETH, which means you can take advantage if traditional tax minimization strategies like simply holding for a year to qualify for long term capital gains tax treatment.
    - Supposedly rETH would be more adopted by apps but curretly stETH is in the lead. No major lending protocals I know of uses rETH yet. But both RP and AAVE [have interest](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf593f2df83cc0b5bdc3920ef2c782f6b2a6f87a6603c26a5d778e3ede4d40021) in adding rETH, though no current progress. 
    - Institutional demand for 'internet-bond' as staking ETH for rETH, shorting ETH on lending platforms will create insane liquidity for ETH/rETH pair to harvest the yield --> leading to large amounts of ETH being staked for rETH

## Bear theses
- Rocketpool starts to become a less popular staking solution (then what?). 
    - Currently Rocket Pool is growing and growing in minipool size and RPL staked (currently 34%) [dune](https://dune.com/NDGcrypto/Rocket-Pool-rETH-and-Nodes)
- Rocketpool gets hacked/drained
    - Solution: not go all-in, risk-management task that will always exist


## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:
- Node operators who want to stake with Rocketpool (main driver)
- speculators

Sellers:
- [5%](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/rewards.html#rewards-and-checkpoints) inflation rewards

### Expected change in supply and demand
Buyers (Increase):
- Increase in ETH staking rewards following merge (?) will lead to more people who want to stake but don't meet 32 ETH requirement, or want extra commission. 
- A lot more speculators once the Merge has completed and people flock to staking after realizing rate and RPL thesis

Sellers (Decrease):
- Buyers likely using RPL as collateral, thus locking it and reducing the liquid supply

## Plan and risk tolerance
- Split up my DCA amounts to incorporate buying some RPL instead of just ETH. Reason: Currently RPL has pumped quite hard, so I am not going to go all in at the top
- Planning to accumulate to 10-30% of my portfolio
- No price-stop loss, but may sell if Rocketpool is hacked, or if other decentralized staking alternatives are gaining share against Rocketpool, or growth has slowed down. 
- No take-profit prices, but am looking for some eurphoric pumps near the Merge. Probably will start DCAing out after I have amassed a large stake 
- Some eyeballing numbers: if holding for a few years, am expecting price to go up to ~0.1 ETH. 
- Ideal play: accumulate, sell most during post-Merge pump, buy back cheaper, hold for a few years and Rocketpool continues to grow

## Possible outcomes and my reactions
### Pre-finished-accumulating
- Large pump happens before I have finished accumulating (like 0.03ETH): I will halt accumulating and wait for it to come back down. If truely excessive (like 0.05ETH), may start selling very small amounts. 
- Price goes up slowly while I am accumulating: given I am DCAing, I will continue until I feel I reached a good amount between 10%-30%
- Price stays ~$25 or goes down due to non-fundamental reasons: DCA doin' work. 

### Post-accumulation
- If price stays the same, falls, may DCA but with less amounts if thesis is still valid
- If price climbs up, slowly DCA out. 
- As a rule of thumb, probably would be looking for an exit to sell above 0.05 ETH AND clearly a massive speculative pump, possibly also in parallel with the pump of other ETH staking derivaties (LDO, SWISE)
