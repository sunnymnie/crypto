# Ethereum Merge thesis

Long Ether due to the Ethereum Merge. 

## About the Merge and Ethereum
- 

## Time horizens and expectations
- earliest is a few months after the merge, up to potentially a year or two after the merge (somewhere in 2024)

## Bull theses
- 13500 new ETH / day [sassal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTXUjyYRpRQ) pre merge issuance to miners, 80% issuance reduction

## Bear theses
- 

## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:

Sellers:

### Expected change in supply and demand
Buyers (Increase):
- institutional demand to buy ETH for staking at a higher yield post-merge

Sellers (Decrease):
- $7b less sell pressure at current ETH prices from the dissolution of miners [1](https://twitter.com/Data_Always/status/1554521769591144448) (? want more sources + more detail)
- higher staking yield make it a better decision to stake rather than to sell (?)

## Plan and risk tolerance
- DCA long ETH short BTC
- Holding spot ETH, aggregating most to Optimism on Aave for OP yield
- Some ETH calls at 3k and 5k strike for eoy
- ETH LSD via RPL


## Possible outcomes and my reactions
- if ETH goes up a lot, hopefully I focus on my DCA and not FOMO in. 
- If ETH pumps a lot during the merge, that most likely would be the institutions we were expecting FOMOing in. 
- Else, if during and after the merge not much activity and maybe even down, that's expected as well (all prior BTC halvenings were like that), hold for longer time frame for the supply changes to manifest in price
