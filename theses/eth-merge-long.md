# Ethereum Merge thesis

Long Ether due to the Ethereum Merge. 

## Time horizens and expectations
- Long term trade waiting for the flows to manifest in the price. May take advantage of short-term euphoric pumps that arrive around the time of the merge. 

## Bull theses
- 13500 new ETH / day [sassal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTXUjyYRpRQ) pre merge issuance to miners, 80% issuance reduction
- Increased staking yield (unlikely). Consensus seems to eyeball 4%, but as _real yield_ as ETH is non-inflating by then. 

## Bear theses
- Execution risk. However: all testnet merges were smooth, and mainnet would work out issues if they arise
- Macro
- Censorship
    - Fear: The entire purpose of ETH/crypto is undermined when the baselayer is not neutral, which is a possibility under PoS when validators collude to exempt transactions as per regulation with OFAC, etc
    - Solution: [Social slashing](https://ercwl.medium.com/the-case-for-social-slashing-59277ff4d9c7). Top US-based centralized staker tentatively will choose to close down than censor [coinbase](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1560016827253551104z). Current staking [relatively](https://dune.com/hildobby/ETH2-Deposits) distributed. In conclusion, very low chance of happening, and even if happens there are known solutions on how to deal with such incidents
- Low fees
    - Fear: There is very little activity on Ethereum, leading to low fees which means not a high enough burn to keep ETH deflationary. 
    - Solution: (1) ETH fees are reflexive and aren't stable, there are natural cycles of periods where fees spike and when chain is calm. As long as useful applications are being built and users are using them, there shouldn't be anything to worry about. (2) [time harvesting](https://youtu.be/jFPqxNjNs1g?t=149), meaning that positive net-incone doesn't need to grow for price to appreciate
    - Conclusion: Low fees like now hamper the tail-end of price appreciation, but they're not permanent as long as builders keep building. 

## Supply and demand
### Current supply and demand
Buyers:
- DCAers and current ETH buyers for use and investment

Sellers:
- Miners

### Expected change in supply and demand
Buyers (Increase):
- institutional demand to buy ETH for staking at a higher yield post-merge

Sellers (Decrease):
- $7b less sell pressure at current ETH prices from the dissolution of miners [1](https://twitter.com/Data_Always/status/1554521769591144448) (? want more sources + more detail)
- higher staking yield make it a better decision to stake rather than to sell (?)

## Plan and risk tolerance
- Long ETH short BTC: purest play for the supply-demand to manifest removing the influence of macro. 
- Spot ETH holdings
- Some ETH calls at 3k and 5k strike for eoy: To take advantage of any pumps around the merge
- ETH LSD via RPL


## Possible outcomes and my reactions 
Be in accumulation phase when prices are falling and there is doubt and FUD about the merge & macro. If BTC is gaining on ETH, will grow ETH/BTC position. Will catch knives with proportional amounts as long as my thesis remains intact and people are scared. If the merge narrative is being blasted and shouted over mainstream news/CT, will start liquidating my levered positions to ETH and USDC (calls > spot ETH > ETH/BTC). 

Trade probably doesn't have a definite end, rather will morph into general long-ETH-ecosystem months/years after the merge, so unlikely I would liquidate most of my ETH unless major flaws arise
